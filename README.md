    Run Ktlint:
        Use the ./gradlew ktlintCheck command to check your Kotlin code for formatting issues. This command will report any errors found.
        To automatically fix issues, use the ./gradlew ktlintFormat command. This will attempt to fix any errors and report those that could not be fixed automatically.
